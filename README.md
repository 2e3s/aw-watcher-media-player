# Media Player watcher

This watcher sends information the media which is playing now to [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/).
It supports any player which can report its status to the system 
and be controllable by tray or standard multimedia keys,
such as Spotify, Foobar, browser-based players, and others. Most media players are supported.

## Installation

- **Linux**:
  - Run `sudo unzip aw-watcher-media-player-linux.zip -d /usr/local/bin` in the console to allow ActivityWatch to detect its presence.
  - Or install the attached _.deb_ file.

  **Windows**:
  - Run the attached installer executable.
  - To install manually and make it available for ActivityWatch,
    unpack the executable from `aw-watcher-media-player-windows.zip` into any new folder,
    right-click on "Start" -> "System" -> "Advanced system settings" - "Advanced" tab -> "Environment Variables..." -> upper "Edit...", add the new folder path.
- Optionally, add `aw-watcher-media-player` to autostart at `aw-qt/aw-qt.toml` in [config directory](https://docs.activitywatch.net/en/latest/directories.html#config).

## Configuration

Configuration file `aw-watcher-media-player.toml` is located in [user's local configuration directory](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.config_local_dir.html).
CLI arguments override the file configuration.
Example:
```toml
port = 5600
host = "localhost"
poll_time = 5
include_players = ["Spotify", "firefox", "chrom"]
exclude_players = ["chromium"]
```
Filter options for including and excluding players for reporting look for a case-insensitive substring.
Use `-vv` to see what's reported.

Note that normally browsers report the currently playing track to the system even in a private mode.

## Build

`cargo build --release` on any platform. See [_release.yml_](https://github.com/2e3s/aw-watcher-media-player/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) for details.
